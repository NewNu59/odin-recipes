    <h2> Description</h2>

    <p> Basil Fried Rice is such a flavorful Thai-inspired fried rice recipe! It starts with a chili and garlic paste that we’ll stir fry with shallots, add shrimp, a few sauces, and a handful of fresh basil leaves! It’s the perfect one-pot recipe!</p>
    <p>We love making this one-pot dinner so much that I’ll make a potful of Jasmine rice the night before with Thai fried rice written all over it. Tender seasoned rice that crisps and pops in the pan when fried in butter. The shrimp add sweetness to the rice dish, the sauce adds a salty umami flavor, and the fresh basil gives off a licorice taste that works beautifully with all the other ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> Jasmine Rice</li>
        <li> Garlic</li>
        <li> Thai chili</li>
        <li> Shrimp</li>
        <li> Onion</li>
        <li> Fish sauce</li>
        <li> Oyster sauce</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
        <li> Tomato for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>Make the garlic chili paste. Start by adding the garlic, red chilies, and a small pinch of salt in a mortar and crush it down with a pestle. Make sure the garlic and chilies are finely minced – almost like a crunchy sauce!</li>
        <li>Make the sauce. Add the oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, and white paper to a bowl and stir it together until the sugar mostly dissolves. Keep this to the side for now.</li>
        <li>Scramble the eggs. Lightly beat the eggs in a bowl. Heat a large skillet, wide Dutch oven, or a wok over medium-high heat. When the wok is hot, add the oil and scramble the eggs in the wok. Then remove the scrambled eggs to a bowl and set this aside for later. You don’t want the eggs to overcook so for my fried rice recipe, I like to get this step done ahead of time.</li>
        <li>Yada yada yada</li>
